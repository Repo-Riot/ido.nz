                        <p class="faq-answer">Easy peasy — just reach out! We'll set up an initial consultation where we chat about your vision, answer any questions, and walk you through how the planning process works. No pressure, no overwhelm — just good vibes and solid guidance from the start.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq-question">Do you plan weddings in specific locations only?</h3>
                        <p class="faq-answer">Nope! While we're based in New Zealand, we love a good road trip (or flight) and happily plan weddings across the country — and beyond. Destination dreams? Let's make them happen.</p>

                        <p class="faq-answer">Absolutely! We know every couple's situation is different, and we're all about flexibility. If you've already locked in a few things and just need help with the rest, we'll create a package that fits.</p>
