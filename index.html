                            <p class="hero-description">Your wedding should reflect who you are — not just as a couple, but as individuals your quirks, your dreams, surrounded by the loved ones you want to celebrate with.</p>
                            <p class="hero-description">My job is to create a day that honours all of that, with seamless planning, a calm presence, and support that feels more like a trusted friend than a clipboard-wielding stranger. Let's make it beautiful. Let's make it meaningful. And let's make sure you get to enjoy every minute.</p>

                        <p class="alex-intro">Hi, I'm Alex — the planner, cheerleader, spreadsheet-slayer, and romantic heart behind I Do Wedding & Event Planning.</p>
                        <p class="alex-story">I've been in the world of events for over two decades, and honestly, I still get goosebumps during the vows. There's something so powerful about helping people celebrate their love — not just in a "that was pretty" kind of way, but in a "that felt exactly like us" kind of way.</p>
                        <p class="alex-story">What started as a passion for organisation, colour palettes and styling has grown into something so much more. I help couples stay calm, feel confident, and actually enjoy the process — not just survive it. Whether we're planning a cosy elopement, a big party with all your favourites, or something beautifully in-between, my role stays the same: support you, guide you, and handle the details so you don't have to.</p>
                        <p class="alex-story">Why do I do this? Because I believe your wedding should feel like home — joyful, meaningful, and full of the people (and snacks) you love. And because watching your day come together — knowing I helped make it happen — fills my cup every time.</p>

                <div class="philosophy-content">
                    <p class="philosophy-intro">I believe weddings aren't about perfection — they're about connection.</p>
                    <p class="philosophy-text">The most beautiful celebrations aren't the ones that follow every trend or run without a single hiccup. They're the ones where the couple is fully present, the guests feel truly looked after, and love is the loudest thing in the room.</p>
                    <p class="philosophy-text">That's the kind of day I want for you.</p>
                    <p class="philosophy-text">I plan with purpose, heart, and a sense of humour — helping you filter out the noise, honour your quirks and dreams, and create a wedding that feels genuinely like you. Whether it's grand and glamorous or intimate and understated, my job is to make everything run smoothly behind the scenes so you can focus on the moments that matter.</p>
                    <p class="philosophy-text">Together, we'll create a day that looks beautiful, feels effortless, and celebrates everything you are — and I'll be there through it all, calm, capable, and clipboard in hand.</p>
